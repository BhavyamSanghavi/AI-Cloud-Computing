# üöÄ Artificial Intelligence Repository

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence** repository! This repository contains various AI-related assignments, each focusing on different search algorithms, problem-solving techniques, and intelligent systems.

## üìå Assignments Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 1: BFS and DFS  
Implemented **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms to explore graph traversal techniques. These fundamental algorithms help in searching through graphs and trees efficiently.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 2: A* Algorithm for 8-Puzzle Problem  
Developed an **A* (A-star) algorithm** to solve the classic **8-puzzle problem**. This heuristic-based search algorithm finds the shortest path to arrange tiles in the correct order.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 3: N-Queens Problem  
Implemented a solution for the **N-Queens problem**, where N queens are placed on an **N√óN chessboard** such that no two queens attack each other. Used **backtracking** and **heuristic approaches** to find optimal solutions.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 4: Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm  
Designed and implemented **Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path algorithm**, which finds the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 5: Medical Chatbot  
Built an **AI-powered medical chatbot** that can answer basic health-related queries. The chatbot utilizes **natural language processing (NLP)** to analyze user inputs and provide relevant medical suggestions.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 6: Expert System for Airline & Cargo Management  
Developed an **expert system** that assists in **airline and cargo management**. The system makes intelligent decisions based on predefined rules and knowledge bases, helping optimize cargo handling and flight management.
